/* A version of the PCM library [1] that was modified by Johan Carlsson
 * (@JohanCar1sson) to allow playing multiple sounds, or the same sound multiple
 * times. Support for bit-crushed audio has also been added (with bit depth
 * reduced to 4, 2 or 1).

 * speaker_pcm
 *
 * Plays 8-bit PCM audio on pin 11 using pulse-width modulation (PWM).
 * For Arduino with Atmega168 at 16 MHz.
 *
 * Uses two timers. The first changes the sample value 8000 times a second.
 * The second holds pin 11 high for 0-255 ticks out of a 256-tick cycle,
 * depending on sample value. The second timer repeats 62500 times per second
 * (16000000 / 256), much faster than the playback rate (8000 Hz), so
 * it almost sounds halfway decent, just really quiet on a PC speaker.
 *
 * Takes over Timer 1 (16-bit) for the 8000 Hz timer. This breaks PWM
 * (analogWrite()) for Arduino pins 9 and 10. Takes Timer 2 (8-bit)
 * for the pulse width modulation, breaking PWM for pins 11 & 3.
